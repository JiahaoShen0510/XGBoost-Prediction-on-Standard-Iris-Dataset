Use the standard Iris dataset that built in scikit-learn, and convert it into the pandas dataframe. 

Apply the XGBoost to implement the softmax and softprob approches to create the prediction models. Further transfer the results from softprob into the actual prediction. 

Both approaches achieve the 100% accuracy rate on the test data.
